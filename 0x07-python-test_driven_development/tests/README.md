# Test Cases

This folder contains test cases for the Python functions implemented in the corresponding source code files. Each test case file is named according to the function it tests.

## File Structure

- `0-lookup.txt`: Test cases for `0-lookup.py`.
- `1-divide.txt`: Test cases for `1-divide.py`.
- `2-matrix_divided.txt`: Test cases for `2-matrix_divided.py`.
- ...

## How to Run Tests

To run the test cases:

1. Navigate to the /tests folder.
2. Use the appropriate testing framework or tool to execute the test cases against the corresponding Python functions.
3. Analyze the output to ensure that each function behaves as expected under various input conditions.

## Notes

- Test cases written by Emmanuel Odenyire Anyira for the ALX Software Engineering Program, specifically for ALX Higher Level Programming in the 0X07 SECTION.
- Each test case file follows a specific format to ensure clarity and consistency.
- Additional test cases may be added as needed to cover edge cases and improve test coverage.
- It's important to maintain synchronization between the test cases and the corresponding function implementations to ensure accurate testing.
