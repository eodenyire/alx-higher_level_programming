# 0x00 Python Hello World

Welcome to the Python Hello World section of the ALX Software Engineering Program! In this directory, you will find a series of tasks aimed at familiarizing you with Python programming fundamentals. Each task is designed to reinforce concepts such as printing, string manipulation, variables, and basic syntax.

## Tasks

1. **Run Python File (0-run)**
   - A bash script that executes a Python script file stored in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.

2. **Run inline (1-run_inline)**
   - A bash script that runs Python code saved in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.

3. **Hello, print (2-print.py)**
   - A Python script that prints a specific string.

4. **Print integer (3-print_number.py)**
   - A Python script that prints an integer stored in a variable.

5. **Print float (4-print_float.py)**
   - A Python script that prints a float with specific precision.

6. **Print string (5-print_string.py)**
   - A Python script that prints a string multiple times and slices it.

7. **Play with strings (6-concat.py)**
   - A Python script that concatenates predefined strings.

8. **Copy - Cut - Paste (7-edges.py)**
   - A Python script that manipulates strings.

9. **Create a new sentence (8-concat_edges.py)**
   - A Python script that prints a specific sentence.

10. **Easter Egg (9-easter_egg.py)**
    - A Python script that prints a specific message.

11. **Linked list cycle (10-check_cycle.c)**
    - A C function that checks for a cycle in a linked list.

12. **Hello, write (100-write.py)**
    - A Python script that prints a message to stderr.

13. **Compile (101-compile)**
    - A Python script that compiles a Python script file.

14. **ByteCode -> Python #1 (102-magic_calculation.py)**
    - A Python function that matches a given bytecode.

## Authorship
