# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

## Overview
This project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, specifically on classes and objects. It covers fundamental concepts such as classes, objects, attributes, methods, encapsulation, and inheritance.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.
- Explain the concepts of classes, objects, and instances.
- Differentiate between public, protected, and private attributes.
- Understand and utilize methods and special methods in classes.
- Implement encapsulation and information hiding.
- Define properties and understand their usage in Python.
- Write and use getter and setter methods.
- Dynamically create attributes for existing instances of a class.
- Utilize class and instance dictionaries (__dict__) in Python.
- Learn how Python finds attributes of an object or class.
- Use the `getattr()` function effectively.

## Resources
To successfully complete this project, it's essential to review the following resources:
- [Object Oriented Programming](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html) (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” excluded. You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, classmethod, and staticmethod yet)
- [Object-Oriented Programming](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) (Be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything in the following paragraphs: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes (You DON’T have to learn about class attributes), Methods, The __init__ Method, “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “Public, Protected, and Private Attributes”)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php)
- [Learn to Program 9 : Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM)
- [Python Classes and Objects](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/class)

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- Documentation is not a simple word; it’s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)

## Tasks
The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of classes and objects in Python. Here's a brief overview:

### 0. My first square
Implement a simple class `Square` with no attributes or methods.

### 1. Square with size
Define a class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size`.

### 2. Size validation
Enhance the `Square` class with size validation.

### 3. Area of a square
Add a method to calculate the area of the square in the `Square` class.

### 4. Access and update private attribute
Implement getter and setter methods for the `size` attribute in the `Square` class.

### 5. Printing a square
Add a method to print the square using the `#` character.

### 6. Coordinates of a square
Extend the `Square` class to include position coordinates for printing.

Remember to adhere strictly to the specified requirements and guidelines for each task.
