## Tasks

### 0. Rectangle #0

Write an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle:

- You must use the class notation for defining your class

File: `0-rectangle.js`

### 1. Rectangle #1

Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle:

- The constructor must take 2 arguments `w` and `h`
- Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`
- Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`

File: `1-rectangle.js`

### 2. Rectangle #2

Enhance the `Rectangle` class:

- If `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object

File: `2-rectangle.js`

### 3. Rectangle #3

Enhance the `Rectangle` class with a method:

- Create an instance method called `print()` that prints the rectangle using the character `X`

File: `3-rectangle.js`

### 4. Rectangle #4

Enhance the `Rectangle` class with more methods:

- Create an instance method called `rotate()` that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle
- Create an instance method called `double()` that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2

File: `4-rectangle.js`

### 5. Square #0

Write a class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from `Rectangle` of `4-rectangle.js`:

- The constructor must take 1 argument: `size`

File: `5-square.js`

### 6. Square #1

Enhance the `Square` class with a method:

- Create an instance method called `charPrint(c)` that prints the square using the character `c`

File: `6-square.js`

### 7. Occurrences

Write a function that returns the number of occurrences in a list:

- Prototype: `exports.nbOccurences = function (list, searchElement)`

File: `7-occurrences.js`

### 8. Esrever

Write a function that returns the reversed version of a list:

- Prototype: `exports.esrever = function (list)`
- You are not allowed to use the built-in method `reverse`

File: `8-esrever.js`

### 9. Log me

Write a function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value:

- Prototype: `exports.logMe = function (item)`
- Output format: `<number arguments already printed>: <current argument value>`

File: `9-logme.js`

### 10. Number conversion

Write a function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument:

- Prototype: `exports.converter = function (base)`

File: `10-converter.js`

### 11. Factor index

Write a script that imports an array and computes a new array:

- Your script must import `list` from the file `100-data.js`
- You must use a map. 
- A new list must be created with each value equal to the value of the initial list, multiplied by the index in the list

File: `100-map.js`

### 12. Sorted occurrences

Write a script that imports a dictionary of occurrences by user id and computes a dictionary of user ids by occurrence:

- Your script must import `dict` from the file `101-data.js`

File: `101-sorted.js`

### 13. Concat files

Write a script that concats 2 files:

- The first argument is the file path of the first source file
- The second argument is the file path of the second source file
- The third argument is the file path of the destination

File: `102-concat.js`
