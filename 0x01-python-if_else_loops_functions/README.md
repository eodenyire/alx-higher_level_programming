### Python - if/else, loops, functions

# 0x01 Python If/Else, Loops, Functions

Welcome to the Python If/Else, Loops, Functions section of the ALX Software Engineering Program! In this directory, you will find a series of tasks aimed at reinforcing your understanding of conditional statements, loops, and functions in Python.

## Tasks

1. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing (0-positive_or_negative.py)**
   - A Python program that assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

2. **The last digit (1-last_digit.py)**
   - A Python program that assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints its last digit along with specific conditions.

3. **I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game (2-print_alphabet.py)**
   - A Python program that prints the alphabet in lowercase without a newline.

4. **When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off (3-print_alphabt.py)**
   - A Python program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', followed by a newline.

5. **Hexadecimal printing (4-print_hexa.py)**
   - A Python program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal format.

6. **00...99 (5-print_comb2.py)**
   - A Python program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 in two-digit format, separated by commas.

7. **Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need (6-print_comb3.py)**
   - A Python program that prints all possible combinations of two digits in ascending order.

8. **islower (7-islower.py)**
   - A Python function that checks if a character is lowercase.

9. **To uppercase (8-uppercase.py)**
   - A Python function that prints a string in uppercase.

10. **There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; its what we do with them that's important (9-print_last_digit.py)**
    - A Python function that prints the last digit of a number.

11. **a + b (10-add.py)**
    - A Python function that returns the addition of two integers.

12. **a ^ b (11-pow.py)**
    - A Python function that returns a to the power of b.

13. **Fizz Buzz (12-fizzbuzz.py)**
    - A Python function that implements the FizzBuzz game.

14. **Insert in sorted linked list (13-insert_number.c)**
    - A C function that inserts a number into a sorted linked list.

15. **Smile in the mirror (100-print_tebahpla.py)**
    - A Python program that prints the alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase.

16. **Remove at position (101-remove_char_at.py)**
    - A Python function that creates a copy of a string without a character at a specified position.

17. **ByteCode -> Python #2 (102-magic_calculation.py)**
    - A Python function that matches a specific bytecode provided by Holberton School.
