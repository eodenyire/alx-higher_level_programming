### Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

# 0x03 Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

Welcome to the Python Data Structures section of the ALX Software Engineering Program! In this directory, you will find a series of tasks aimed at reinforcing your understanding of lists, tuples, and basic data structure operations in Python.

## Tasks

1. **Print list integer (0-print_list_integer.py)**
   - A Python function that prints all integers of a list.

2. **Element at (1-element_at.py)**
   - A Python function that retrieves an element from a list at a specific index.

3. **Replace in list (2-replace_in_list.py)**
   - A Python function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position.

4. **Print reversed list integer (3-print_reversed_list_integer.py)**
   - A Python function that prints all integers of a list in reverse order.

5. **New in list (4-new_in_list.py)**
   - A Python function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

6. **No C (5-no_c.py)**
   - A Python function that removes all occurrences of character 'c' or 'C' from a string.

7. **Print matrix integer (6-print_matrix_integer.py)**
   - A Python function that prints a matrix of integers.

8. **Add tuple (7-add_tuple.py)**
   - A Python function that adds elements of two tuples.

9. **Multiple returns (8-multiple_returns.py)**
   - A Python function that returns the length of a string and its first character.

10. **Max integer (9-max_integer.py)**
    - A Python function that finds the biggest integer in a list.

11. **Divisible by 2 (10-divisible_by_2.py)**
    - A Python function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

12. **Delete at (11-delete_at.py)**
    - A Python function that deletes an element at a specific position in a list.

13. **Switch (12-switch.py)**
    - A Python program that switches the values of two variables.

14. **Is palindrome (13-is_palindrome.c)**
    - A C program that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

15. **Print Python list info (100-print_python_list_info.c)**
    - A C function to compile in a shared library that prints information about a Python list.

## Authorship

These tasks have been handled by Emmanuel Odenyire Anyira for the ALX Software Engineering Program.

## Location of Files

The files for these tasks can be found in the `/0x03-python-data_structures/` directory of the ALX Software Engineering Program repository.
