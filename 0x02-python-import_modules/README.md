### Python - Import and Modules

# 0x02 Python Import & Modules

Welcome to the Python Import & Modules section of the ALX Software Engineering Program! In this directory, you will find a series of tasks aimed at reinforcing your understanding of importing and using functions, creating modules, and handling command line arguments in Python.

## Tasks

1. **Import a simple function from a simple file (0-add.py)**
   - A Python program that imports a function from a file and prints the result of the addition.

2. **My first toolbox! (1-calculation.py)**
   - A Python program that imports functions from a file and performs various arithmetic operations.

3. **How to make a script dynamic! (2-args.py)**
   - A Python program that prints the number of and list of its arguments.

4. **Infinite addition (3-infinite_add.py)**
   - A Python program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments.

5. **Who are you? (4-hidden_discovery.py)**
   - A Python program that prints all the names defined by a compiled module.

6. **Everything can be imported (5-variable_load.py)**
   - A Python program that imports a variable from a file and prints its value.

7. **Build my own calculator! (100-my_calculator.py)**
   - A Python program that imports functions from a file and handles basic arithmetic operations.

8. **Easy print (101-easy_print.py)**
   - A Python program that prints a specific message without using certain functions.

9. **ByteCode -> Python #3 (102-magic_calculation.py)**
   - A Python function matching a specific bytecode provided by Holberton School.

10. **Fast alphabet (103-fast_alphabet.py)**
    - A Python program that prints the alphabet in uppercase without using certain constructs.

## Authorship

These tasks have been handled by Emmanuel Odenyire Anyira for the ALX Software Engineering Program.

## Location of Files

The files for these tasks can be found in the `/0x02-python-import_modules/` directory of the ALX Software Engineering Program repository.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the scripts to deepen your understanding of Python programming!
