# ALX Higher Level Programming - Python Everything is Object

This repository contains solutions to the tasks in the ALX Higher Level Programming sprint for the topic "Python Everything is Object".

## About

This section of the ALX Software Engineering Program covers foundational concepts in Python programming, focusing on the idea that everything in Python is an object. It explores topics such as object types, mutability, immutability, aliasing, and object referencing.

## Tasks

The tasks in this repository include a series of questions and exercises aimed at deepening understanding of Python's object-oriented nature. Each task has a corresponding answer file that provides concise solutions.

## Repository Structure

- `0-answer.txt` to `34-answer.txt`: Answer files for each task.
- `19-copy_list.py`: Python script for copying a list without using any module.
- `100-magic_string.py`: Python script for generating a string "BestSchool" a certain number of times.
- `101-locked_class.py`: Python script for implementing a locked class that restricts attribute creation.
