# 0x05. Python - Exceptions

## Overview
This project delves into the topic of handling exceptions in Python. It covers the fundamental concepts of errors, exceptions, and how to properly handle them in your code. The tasks involved require implementing various functions that demonstrate exception handling techniques.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the difference between errors and exceptions.
- Recognize exceptions and know how to use them.
- Know when and how to handle exceptions effectively.
- Understand the purpose of catching exceptions.
- Know how to raise built-in exceptions.
- Implement clean-up actions after exceptions when necessary.

## Resources
To successfully complete this project, you may want to refer to the following resources:
- [Errors and Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)
- "Learn to Program 11 Static & Exception Handling" (starting at minute 7)

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks
The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on a different aspect of exception handling in Python. Here's a brief overview:

### 0. Safe list printing
Write a function that prints a specified number of elements from a list, handling potential exceptions.

### 1. Safe printing of an integers list
Implement a function that prints an integer from a given value.

### 2. Print and count integers
Create a function that prints the first x integers from a list and counts the total number of integers printed.

### 3. Integers division with debug
Write a function that divides two integers and prints the result, while handling potential exceptions.

### 4. Divide a list
Implement a function that divides two lists element by element and handles various types of exceptions.

### 5. Raise exception
Write a function that raises a type exception.

### 6. Raise a message
Create a function that raises a name exception with a custom message.

Remember, for each task, you should strictly adhere to the specified requirements and guidelines.
